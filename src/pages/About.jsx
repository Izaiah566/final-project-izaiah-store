        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We’re building a community-first marketplace where people can buy, sell,
          and connect with others in their area or niche. Whether you're a local
          artisan, freelancer, or someone with something to share — this is your space.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Our mission is to empower individuals and small businesses by providing
          a platform that’s easy to use, transparent, and community-driven.
